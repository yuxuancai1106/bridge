"Good morning judges! Today I'm excited to present Bridge - a platform that connects generations through meaningful relationships.

THE PROBLEM:
- 1 in 3 older adults experience loneliness
- Students struggle with mentorship and affordable housing
- Generational wisdom is being lost
- Current solutions are fragmented and unsafe

OUR SOLUTION:
Bridge is like a 'non-romantic Tinder' for community and wisdom exchange. We use AI-powered matching to connect older adults with students for companionship, mentorship, and mutual support.

Let me show you how it works:

1. LANDING PAGE DEMO
'Here's our beautiful landing page. Notice the clear value proposition - we're not just another dating app. We're building bridges between generations.'

2. ONBOARDING DEMO
'Let me show you our wizard-style onboarding. We collect meaningful information for matching - interests, personality, availability, and motivation. Notice how we make it accessible for older users with larger fonts and clear steps.'

3. SMART MATCHING DEMO
'Here's where the magic happens. Our AI algorithm considers interest overlap, personality compatibility, motivation alignment, and location. Look at this 87% compatibility score with Alex Chen - we share 3 interests and have complementary personalities.'

4. CHAT SYSTEM DEMO
'Once matched, users can start chatting immediately. Notice the conversation starters, safety tips, and verification badges. We make it easy to break the ice while keeping everyone safe.'

5. IMPACT DASHBOARD DEMO
'Users can track their impact. Mary has made 12 connections, sent 247 messages, and spent 18.5 hours helping students. This gamification encourages continued engagement.'

6. SAFETY FEATURES DEMO
'Safety is our top priority. We have verified profiles, community moderation, comprehensive guidelines, and emergency resources. Users know they're protected.'

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript for modern, scalable frontend
- Supabase for real-time database, auth, and messaging
- AI-powered matching algorithm with multiple scoring factors
- Comprehensive safety and verification system
- Mobile-responsive design with accessibility features

SOCIAL IMPACT:
- Reduces loneliness among older adults
- Provides mentorship opportunities for students
- Creates intergenerational understanding
- Builds stronger communities
- Scalable to housing partnerships

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Freemium with premium features
- Housing partnership commissions
- Corporate mentorship programs
- Educational institution partnerships

NEXT STEPS:
- Launch beta with 100 users
- Partner with senior centers and universities
- Add video calling features
- Expand to housing marketplace
- Scale to 10,000+ users

Bridge isn't just an app - it's a movement to reconnect generations and build stronger communities. Every match we create reduces loneliness and spreads wisdom.

Thank you for your time. Questions?"
